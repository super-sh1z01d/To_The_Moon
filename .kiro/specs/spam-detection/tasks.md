## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1):
- 1.1 RPC Client for Transaction Analysis
- 1.2 Spam Pattern Detection Engine
- 1.3 Spam Score Calculation
- 1.4 Database Schema for Spam Metrics

### Medium Priority (Week 2):
- 2.1 Spam Analysis Service
- 2.2 API Endpoints
- 2.3 Token Scoring Integration
- 2.4 Scheduler Integration

### Low Priority (Week 3):
- 3.1 Enhanced Detection Algorithms
- 3.2 Performance Optimization
- 3.3 Monitoring and Alerts
- 3.4 Testing and Validation

## Technical Considerations

### RPC Providers:
- Primary: Helius (enhanced transaction APIs)
- Secondary: QuickNode (backup and load balancing)
- Fallback: Public Solana RPC (rate limited)

### Caching Strategy:
- Redis for spam scores (10 minute TTL)
- Database for historical data (30 days detailed)
- In-memory cache for active analysis (5 minutes)

### Performance Targets:
- Spam analysis: <30 seconds per token
- API response: <2 seconds
- Batch processing: 50 tokens per minute
- Cache hit rate: >80%

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation on RPC failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached results when possible
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
