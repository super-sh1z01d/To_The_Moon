# Spam Detection System Requirements

## Overview
Implement a system to detect and measure competitor spam activity for tokens to provide a "spam score" metric that helps identify artificially inflated token activity.

## User Stories

### US-1: Spam Transaction Detection
**As a** token analyst  
**I want** to detect spam transactions from competitors  
**So that** I can identify artificially inflated token activity  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System can identify suspicious transaction patterns
- Detects multiple small transactions from same addresses
- Identifies new wallets with minimal history
- Calculates spam probability score (0-100%)

### US-2: Spam Metrics Integration
**As a** system user  
**I want** spam metrics integrated into token scoring  
**So that** I can make better investment decisions  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Spam score is calculated for all active tokens
- Spam metrics are stored in database
- Spam score affects overall token rating
- Historical spam data is tracked

### US-3: Spam Detection API
**As a** developer  
**I want** API endpoints for spam detection  
**So that** I can access spam metrics programmatically  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GET /tokens/{mint}/spam-analysis endpoint
- Real-time spam score calculation
- Historical spam trend data
- Detailed spam transaction breakdown

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: RPC Integration
- Integrate with Solana RPC for transaction data
- Support for Helius/QuickNode enhanced APIs
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Efficient batch processing

### TR-2: Spam Detection Algorithms
- Pattern recognition for suspicious activity
- Statistical analysis of transaction timing
- Wallet behavior analysis
- Machine learning-ready feature extraction

### TR-3: Performance Requirements
- Process spam analysis within 30 seconds per token
- Cache results for 10 minutes
- Handle up to 100 concurrent spam analyses
- Minimal impact on existing token processing

### TR-4: Data Storage
- Store spam metrics in database
- Track historical spam trends
- Efficient querying for dashboard display
- Data retention policy (30 days detailed, 1 year aggregated)

## Spam Detection Criteria

### High Spam Indicators:
1. **Repetitive Patterns**: Same amounts, regular intervals
2. **New Wallet Activity**: Wallets created within 24 hours
3. **Minimal Balance**: Wallets with dust amounts only
4. **High Frequency**: >10 transactions per hour from same address
5. **Round Numbers**: Transactions with round SOL amounts
6. **Bot-like Timing**: Transactions at exact intervals

### Medium Spam Indicators:
1. **Similar Amounts**: Transactions within 5% of each other
2. **Burst Activity**: Sudden spikes in transaction volume
3. **Low Value**: Transactions under $1 USD equivalent
4. **Address Clustering**: Related addresses with similar patterns

### Spam Score Calculation:
```
Spam Score = (
    repetitive_pattern_score * 0.3 +
    new_wallet_score * 0.25 +
    frequency_score * 0.2 +
    amount_pattern_score * 0.15 +
    timing_pattern_score * 0.1
) * 100
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems:
- Token scoring system (add spam penalty)
- Database models (add spam metrics table)
- API routes (add spam endpoints)
- Scheduler (add periodic spam analysis)
- Telegram notifications (spam alerts)

### External APIs:
- Solana RPC (getSignaturesForAddress, getTransaction)
- Helius Enhanced API (token transactions)
- DexScreener (transaction volume validation)
- Jupiter API (swap transaction analysis)

## Success Metrics

### Accuracy Metrics:
- Spam detection accuracy >85%
- False positive rate <10%
- Processing time <30s per token
- API response time <2s

### Business Metrics:
- Improved token quality scoring
- Reduced false positive investments
- Enhanced user trust in platform
- Better competitive intelligence

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Detection (Week 1)
- Basic RPC integration
- Simple pattern detection
- Spam score calculation
- Database schema

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (Week 2)
- Machine learning features
- Historical trend analysis
- API endpoints
- Dashboard integration

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
- Performance tuning
- Caching optimization
- Alert system integration
- Documentation and testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- RPC rate limits → Use multiple providers
- False positives → Implement confidence scoring
- Performance impact → Async processing and caching
- Data accuracy → Multiple validation sources

### Business Risks:
- Competitor adaptation → Regular algorithm updates
- Legal concerns → Focus on public blockchain data only
- User confusion → Clear spam score explanations
