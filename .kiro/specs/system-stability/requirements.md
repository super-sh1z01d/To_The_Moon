# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of a comprehensive system stability and monitoring solution for the To The Moon token scoring system. The goal is to ensure 99.9% uptime and automatic recovery from common failure scenarios through proactive monitoring, self-healing mechanisms, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed health monitoring of all system components, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide a detailed health endpoint at `/health/scheduler` with comprehensive diagnostics
2. WHEN a scheduler group fails to run THEN the system SHALL detect this within 60 seconds and log an alert
3. WHEN API error rates exceed 20% THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert and attempt recovery
4. WHEN token processing stops for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the affected components
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds 1GB THEN the system SHALL trigger cleanup procedures and log a warning
6. WHEN CPU usage exceeds 80% for more than 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL reduce processing load and alert administrators

### Requirement 2: Automatic Recovery and Self-Healing

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to automatically recover from common failures, so that manual intervention is minimized and uptime is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduler settings are changed THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the scheduler with new settings within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a scheduler job becomes stuck THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the job after 2 minutes
3. WHEN DexScreener API fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern and retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN memory leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL perform automatic cleanup and garbage collection
5. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect with retry logic
6. WHEN the entire service becomes unresponsive THEN systemd watchdog SHALL restart the service automatically

### Requirement 3: Resilient External API Integration

**User Story:** As a system component, I need resilient integration with external APIs like DexScreener, so that temporary API issues don't cause system-wide failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DexScreener API returns rate limit errors THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with maximum 30 second delay
2. WHEN DexScreener API times out THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
3. WHEN DexScreener API is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL use circuit breaker pattern and skip processing for 5 minutes
4. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and continue with other tokens
5. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry when connectivity is restored
6. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL reduce request frequency automatically

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed performance metrics and automatic optimization, so that the system maintains optimal performance under varying loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust processing parameters to maintain stability
2. WHEN processing queues grow large THEN the system SHALL increase parallelism or reduce batch sizes as appropriate
3. WHEN API response times increase THEN the system SHALL implement adaptive timeouts and caching
4. WHEN database queries become slow THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings and suggest optimizations
5. WHEN memory usage patterns indicate leaks THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic cleanup procedures
6. WHEN CPU usage spikes THEN the system SHALL temporarily reduce processing load to prevent system overload

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Logging and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want structured logging and intelligent alerting, so that I can quickly diagnose issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component encounters an error THEN it SHALL log structured information with context and correlation IDs
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts through configured channels
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed metrics and trigger appropriate alerts
4. WHEN system recovery actions are taken THEN the system SHALL log the actions and their outcomes
5. WHEN trends indicate potential future issues THEN the system SHALL provide predictive warnings
6. WHEN log volume becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation and compression automatically

### Requirement 6: External Monitoring Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want external monitoring tools to verify system health, so that I have independent verification of system status and can receive alerts even if the main system fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main application becomes unresponsive THEN external monitoring SHALL detect this within 2 minutes and restart the service
2. WHEN scheduler stops processing tokens THEN external monitoring SHALL detect stale data and trigger recovery
3. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN external monitoring SHALL detect resource issues and take corrective action
4. WHEN database connectivity is lost THEN external monitoring SHALL detect and attempt to restore connectivity
5. WHEN the system fails to start after restart THEN external monitoring SHALL escalate to manual intervention
6. WHEN multiple recovery attempts fail THEN external monitoring SHALL send critical alerts to administrators

### Requirement 7: Graceful Degradation Under Load

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to gracefully handle high load situations, so that the system remains stable and continues to provide core functionality even under stress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL reduce non-essential processing and focus on core functionality
2. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce request frequency
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL reduce cache sizes and batch processing sizes
4. WHEN database connections are limited THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and queuing
5. WHEN processing queues become full THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-value tokens and defer low-priority processing
6. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached data where possible

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management and Hot Reloading

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update system configuration without downtime, so that I can tune performance and fix issues without service interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduler settings are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes within 30 seconds without dropping in-flight requests
2. WHEN monitoring thresholds are changed THEN the system SHALL update alerting rules immediately
3. WHEN API timeout settings are modified THEN the system SHALL apply new timeouts to subsequent requests
4. WHEN logging levels are changed THEN the system SHALL adjust log output without restart
5. WHEN feature flags are toggled THEN the system SHALL enable/disable features dynamically
6. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL reject changes and maintain current stable configuration
