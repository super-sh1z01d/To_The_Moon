# Requirements Document: Frontend Redesign

## Introduction

Complete redesign and optimization of the To The Moon frontend application. The current implementation suffers from performance issues, lacks modern UI components, and needs better mobile responsiveness. This redesign will implement shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS, optimize data fetching with TanStack Query, add dark theme support, and include data visualization with charts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modern UI Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, beautiful interface with consistent design patterns, so that the application is pleasant to use and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL use shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS styling
2. WHEN viewing any page THEN all UI elements SHALL follow consistent design patterns from shadcn/ui
3. WHEN interacting with buttons, inputs, and forms THEN they SHALL have smooth animations and proper feedback
4. WHEN the application renders THEN it SHALL support both light and dark themes
5. IF user switches theme THEN the preference SHALL be persisted in localStorage
6. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN all components SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching token data THEN the application SHALL use TanStack Query for caching and automatic refetching
2. WHEN displaying large token lists THEN the application SHALL use virtualization to render only visible rows
3. WHEN typing in search/filter fields THEN input SHALL be debounced to reduce API calls
4. WHEN data is cached THEN subsequent page loads SHALL be instant (< 100ms)

3. WHEN sorting columns THEN the sort SHALL be applied instantly without full page reload
4. WHEN scrolling through tokens THEN only visible rows SHALL be rendered
5. WHEN clicking a token row THEN it SHALL navigate to detail page with smooth transition
6. WHEN data updates THEN new tokens SHALL appear with subtle animation
7. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN table SHALL switch to card layout
8. WHEN hovering over metrics THEN tooltips SHALL explain the values

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Token Detail Page

**User Story:** As a trader, I want detailed token information with visual charts, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

5. WHEN viewing spam metrics THEN it SHALL display spam percentage with visual indicators
6. WHEN viewing score components THEN it SHALL show breakdown with visual weights
7. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN cards SHALL stack vertically with full width
8. WHEN data updates THEN charts SHALL animate smoothly to new values
9. WHEN clicking external links THEN they SHALL open in new tabs
10. WHEN copying addresses THEN a copy button SHALL provide one-click copying

### Requirement 5: Complete Settings Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want access to all system settings in one place, so that I can configure the entire system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing settings THEN ALL configuration options SHALL be visible and organized by category
2. WHEN viewing settings THEN categories SHALL include:
   - Scoring Model Configuration (weights, thresholds)
   - Token Lifecycle (archive, monitoring timeouts)
   - Data Filtering (liquidity, volume thresholds)
   - NotArb Integration (score, spam thresholds, whitelist)
   - Backlog Monitoring (warning, error, critical thresholds)
   - Spam Detection (whitelist wallets)
   - System Performance (intervals, batch sizes)
3. WHEN searching settings THEN results SHALL filter in real-time
4. WHEN editing a setting THEN validation SHALL occur before saving
5. WHEN saving settings THEN success/error feedback SHALL be immediate
6. WHEN settings are invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
7. WHEN viewing setting descriptions THEN helpful tooltips SHALL explain each option
8. WHEN resetting settings THEN a confirmation dialog SHALL prevent accidents
9. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN settings SHALL be easily scrollable and editable

### Requirement 6: Dark Theme Support
