## Content Update Requirements

### README.md - Major Rewrite Needed
**Current Issues:**
- References old scoring models
- Missing hybrid momentum information
- Outdated setup instructions
- Incomplete feature list

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Hybrid momentum scoring model description
- [ ] Current API endpoints
- [ ] Updated deployment methods
- [ ] Recent system improvements (scheduler monitoring, data quality)
- [ ] Correct technology stack

### API_REFERENCE.md - Significant Updates
**Missing Content:**
- [ ] /health/scheduler endpoint
- [ ] Updated token response models (raw_components, smoothed_components)
- [ ] Hybrid momentum scoring parameters
- [ ] Enhanced error responses
- [ ] New admin endpoints

### ARCHITECTURE.md - Major Updates Required
**Outdated Sections:**
- [ ] Scoring model architecture (still shows old model)
- [ ] Missing EWMA smoothing service
- [ ] Missing scheduler health monitoring
- [ ] Missing data quality validation system
- [ ] Missing fallback mechanisms

### DEVELOPMENT.md - Consolidation Needed
**Sources to Merge:**
- Current DEVELOPMENT.md
- conventions.md
- Scattered development info in other files

## Consolidation Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure (Completed)
- [x] Create docs/ directory
- [x] Create archive/ directory
- [x] Create navigation files

### Phase 2: Core Updates (Next)
1. Rewrite README.md with current system state
2. Update and move ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Update and move API_REFERENCE.md
4. Create new SCORING_MODEL.md

### Phase 3: Consolidation
1. Merge deployment guides into docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
2. Merge development docs into docs/DEVELOPMENT.md + CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Create docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Phase 4: Archival
1. Move implementation reports to archive/reports/
2. Move outdated content to archive/deprecated/
3. Move old migration guides to archive/migrations/

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. Remove consolidated source files
2. Update cross-references
3. Validate all links
