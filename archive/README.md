# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and implementation reports that are no longer part of the active documentation but are preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

### `/reports/` - Implementation Reports
Historical reports documenting feature implementations, enhancements, and system changes. These provide valuable context about the evolution of the system but are not needed for current operations.

**Key Reports:**
- Dashboard enhancement summaries
- Implementation completion reports  
- Settings and UI improvement reports
- System cleanup and optimization reports

### `/deprecated/` - Outdated Documentation
Documentation that has been superseded by newer versions or consolidated into other files. Kept for historical reference and to prevent information loss.

**Categories:**
- Old deployment guides
- Legacy API documentation
- Outdated development instructions
- Parameter removal notices
- Migration guides for old versions

## Navigation

### For Current Documentation
- **Main Documentation**: See `/docs/` directory in project root
- **README**: See `README.md` in project root
- **API Reference**: See `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- **Development Guide**: See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

### For Historical Context
- Browse `/reports/` for implementation history
- Check `/deprecated/` for old versions of current documentation
- Use git history for detailed change tracking

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference Archive
- Understanding historical decisions and implementations
- Researching past issues and their solutions
- Reviewing evolution of features and architecture
- Checking deprecated functionality before removal

### When NOT to Use Archive
- Setting up new development environment (use current docs)
- Learning current API or system architecture
- Following deployment procedures
- Understanding current scoring models

## Maintenance

This archive is maintained to:
- Preserve institutional knowledge
- Provide context for future decisions
- Support debugging of legacy issues
- Document the evolution of the system

Files are moved here when they become outdated or are consolidated into newer documentation, but the information may still have historical value.
